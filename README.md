# Google-Calendar-and-Typeform-API-Integration
Last summer, I interned at a local start up in Guatemala as a software engineer. I worked with the team that was developing an “uber of services” app for services such as plumbing, electrician, craftsman, among others.   During my internship, I was responsible for integrating Google Calendar’s API with Typeform’s API. The purpose of doing so was that for each survey we received from our workers (where they told us their work availability), the program would automatically process the responses and update the main calendar in the server accordingly to allow for quicker and more efficient bookings
